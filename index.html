							<h2>UofT Snow Day/Extreme Weather Policy</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>I plan to increase accessibility with a better snow day policy by lobbying the university to establish a "transparent" policy on meters of snow needed on the ground during dangerous weather for school closure, as well as advocate for timely campus closures based on commuter priority and the satellite campus responses.</p>
							<p> I plan to open up a channel of communication between the university administration and the average student in order to ensure that student needs are reflected in the updated Weather Alert policy. - Additionally, I plan to work with the University, the VP External and the City of Toronto to ensure that UofT sidewalks are accessible to everyone and shoveled on a high priority basis, as well do an student audit to understand which intersections are most unsafe for students during snow days.</p>
							<p> Lastly I will work to ensure that a better contingency plan is created in case of late university closures so that there could be a more comfortable, low stress spaces for students to take shelter in, instead of Robarts.</p>

							<h2>More Inclusive Mental Health Policy</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p> In the wake of the unfortunate events at Bahen last night, the need for this has become even more stark. I plan to lobby the university to:</p>
							<ul class="features">
								<li>Increase UHIP Coverage to include free mental health checkups outside the University for international studentss</li>
								<li> Increase staff at the Health and Wellness as well as the Mental Health Center to: </li>
								<ul>
									<li>answer phone calls more frequently</li>
									<li> hold more drop-in sessions</li>
									<li>shorter wait times</li>
									<li>provide more same day appointment</li>
									<li>ensure that the service is open for later (especially since a lot of students have classes till 9 pm)</li>
									<li>hold a mandatory check-in with first year students after the first semester</li>
									<li> promote follow-ups within 72 hours, and check-in on students disengaging abruptly </li>
									<li> create an online booking system integrated into your UofT calendar to ensure easier access to mental health services</li>
									<li> reduce fines for missing an appointment as this discourages 
students to book another in the future  </li>
								</ul>
							</ul>
							<p>Improve the website design for UofT mental health to make it more accessible, as well as add more information about the doctors and therapists to make them more approachable. This would also involve integrating all the services available to the students on one platform so that easier communication can be maintained between the registrar, mental health and wellness, student groups and accessibility services.</p>
							<p> Form partnerships with therapy groups across GTA and create events and lectures based on these partnerships to allow students to form helpful connections beyond the University, and reduce stigma.</p>
							<p> Combating the mandatory leave system with a better equipped decision committee. No student should be removed against their will from campus based on mental health issues.</p>
							<p> Establish a lounge/meditation area in Robarts with couches and sleeping pods so that students can take a break from studying and improve stress and mental health. This is also extremely important if UofT plans to keep Robarts open during snow days.</p>

							<h2>Improved channels of communication</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>I plan to lobby the university to create a university wide official forum (not unlike reddit but endorsed by UofT) with it's own team, involving UTSU executives, University admins, and a selected group of Student representatives, to manage responses so that students can receive timely responses or updates on university policies such as in cases of Extreme Weather Alert. This would also serve as a live feedback system where students can provide anonymous or non-anonymous feedback on University affairs and their needs which will hold the UTSU and UofT accountable.</p>

							<h2> Class re-takes for Grade Improvement</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>I plan to work with the academic committees on UofT to ensure greater flexibility on course selection and a lighter course load. One of my initiatives would be ensure a Class Re-take and Grade Forgiveness system. Many universities in North America already implement this system. This would allow students to re-take a class for the purpose of improving their GPA. While both attempts would appear on the transcript, their second attempt at class re-take shall be counted while calculating the cGPA. Currently UofT only allows class re-takes for the purpose of obtaining degree requirements and passing. As part of my initiative, there would be a system in place where each student can approach their registrar or faculty to avail this service for Class Re-take, much like the Late Withdrawal system (LWD). The students will work with specific learning strategist the second time around to allow grade improvement to occur. This will reduce stress and allow students to explore different subject areas without extreme penalties.</p>

							<h2>  Ensure higher food security on campus</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p> I plan to lobby the university to increase food security on campus with establishment of an affordable, healthy 24 hours food joint, possibly in an area easily accessible by everyone such as Robarts. This is an extremely important initiative especially in the wake of Robarts being declared a place of recuse during snow-storms. </p>

							<h2> Work for a positive transition with the Student Choice Initiative</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p> I plan to lobby the university to create working policies that would ensure that the effects of the Student Choice Initiative and the OSAP funding cuts are felt positively across campus. The first step in this process would be creating an open town hall consultation process to understand students' campus experiences, and ensuring that the student voice is the most important one in the process.</p>

							<h2> Improve the International Student Experience </h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p> International students make up nearly 25-30% of the student population and their fees are a huge source of operational funding for the university. However, there is a clear gap in the international student experience. With the Student Choice Initiative, there is a real risk that this gap will increase, therefore I plan to lobby the university to establish better support systems for these students. There should be another establishment like the CIE (Centre for International Experience) that aids CIE with additional resources to allow international students to integrate within the broader community. I also support tuition freezes especially for international fees, and I plan to work with different committees to ensure that higher funding, bursaries and scholarships are available to international students based on their financial need.</p>

							<h2>  Possibly leave the CFS </h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p> The UTSU has been paying approximately $750,000 in membership to the Canadian Federation of Students, with little to show for it. If there are no improvements in the immediate future, UTSU should advocate to leave the organisation since it is an ineffective bureaucracy; the funding saved in the process could to be applied to one of the above initiatives.</p>
